# Estafet Microservices Scrum Gateway API

## What is this?
This microservice is serving as a API Gateway in Estafet Scrum Demo Application.
The API Gateway is used as a single entry point for all microservices.
The API Gateway handles requests and then they are proxied/routed to the appropriate service.
It's important not to confuse a microservice API gateway with API management. 
What a microservices API Gateway provides is a front end used to access the microservices underneathâ€”there is no support for publishing, promoting, or administering services at any significant level.

Each microservice has it's own git repository, but there is a master git repository that contains links to all of the repositories [here](https://github.com/Estafet-LTD/estafet-microservices-scrum).
## Getting Started
You can find a detailed explanation of how to install this (and other microservices) [here](https://github.com/Estafet-LTD/estafet-microservices-scrum#getting-started).
